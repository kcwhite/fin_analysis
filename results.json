        "content": "Is Microsoft Stock A Buy As Software Giant Touts Artificial Intelligence? BREAKING: Tech Futures Fall As Amazon Erases After-Hours Gains Software giant Microsoft (MSFT) has earned plaudits for its successful pivot from desktop computing to cloud computing. And MSFT stock has risen as a result. But after a recent pullback, many investors may be wondering: Is Microsoft stock a buy right now? Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft in 1975 at the dawn of the personal computer era to make PC operating system software. The company's Windows operating system came to dominate the PC landscape. Microsoft expanded over the years into productivity software, server software, internet services, video games, and PC hardware and accessories. Current Chief Executive Satya Nadella took the reins of the Redmond, Wash.-based company in 2014 and led Microsoft full steam into cloud computing. Recently, he has been promoting the company's advances in artificial intelligence. The company's cloud offerings today include Azure infrastructure services, Office 365 productivity software and Dynamics enterprise software. Also, Microsoft owns LinkedIn, Skype and GitHub. Microsoft is gaining on Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services in the market for cloud infrastructure services. In the fourth quarter, Amazon Web Services had 32% market share, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft was in second place with 23% market share. Other major cloud players include Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google Cloud Platform, as well as China's Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY). Overall enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services reached $65.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% year over year, Canalys said. Microsoft lately has been promoting its efforts to infuse artificial intelligence into its software and services. On Jan. 23, Microsoft announced a new investment, reportedly worth $10 billion, in artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. OpenAI is the organization behind text generator ChatGPT and image generator Dall-E. Microsoft previously had invested in OpenAI in 2019 and 2021. Microsoft is providing its Azure cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. It also is adding OpenAI models to its consumer and enterprise software products. On Feb. 7, Microsoft showed off its new Bing search engine and Edge web browser that use AI technology. Microsoft hopes the OpenAI-based technology can help Bing chip away at Google's dominance in the internet search market. MSFT stock jumped 4.2% on the news. On March 16, Microsoft announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications. It introduced a feature called Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Copilot feature uses next-generation AI to automate and simplify tasks and provide suggestions. Microsoft stock surged on the news. On March 28, Microsoft added AI to its cybersecurity offerings. It launched Microsoft Security Copilot, a new tool for enterprises to quickly detect and respond to threats and better understand the threat landscape. Meanwhile, Microsoft's proposed acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is facing challenges from antitrust regulators. Microsoft announced a deal to buy Activision in January 2022 for $68.7 billion in cash.\u00a0Microsoft said the Activision purchase will accelerate the growth of its gaming business and provide building blocks for the coming metaverse. But Microsoft stock fell 2.4% on the news. On Dec. 8, the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft's purchase of Activision. Microsoft is fighting the lawsuit. The acquisition also faces regulatory objections in Europe. Late on Jan. 24, Microsoft reported mixed results for the December quarter and gave disappointing guidance. MSFT stock dipped 0.6% in the next trading session after the report. Microsoft earned an adjusted $2.32 a share on sales of $52.7 billion in the December quarter.

(AAPL) Inverted Hammer Subscribe to Yahoo Finance Plus to view Fair Value for AAPL Klarna\u2019s CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski is not worried about competition with Apple. The tech giant introduced its buy now pay later offering, Apple Pay Later, in March but Siemiatkowski doesn't feel the pressure just yet. He joined Yahoo Finance to discuss the growing buy now pay later space. Siemiatkowski said he loves Apple (AAPL) Pay, but it hasn\u2019t caught up to Klarna yet, \u201cthere\u2019s so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we\u2019re doing.\u201d When it comes to other major companies in the space, Siemiatkowski said that in his 18 years in the business Klarna has stayed competitive. \u201cFirst it was like Paypal (PYPL) is too big and they were going to kill us in the Nordics and they were going to kill us in the German speaking countries, and then they were going to kill us in the UK and here we are now killing them in the U.S.,\u201d he said. Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. \u201cIt's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company,\u201d he said. Watch the full interview with Seana Smith and Dave Briggs here.

Apple\u2019s initial public offering in 1980 raised more capital than any other IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956. What\u2019s more, it created instant millionaires out of about 300 employees. Apple\u2019s stock price at IPO was $22 per share. (read more) But it was a long road to these millions for Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, both college dropouts, who set out to design a user-friendly personal computer from the garage of Jobs\u2019 parent`s house in Los Altos, California in Silicon Valley. A local computer store chain, The Byte Shop, was planning to sell Steve Jobs\u2019 bare circuit boards for $40 each, but instead was convinced to order 50 of Jobs\u2019 fully assembled Apple I computers, paying $500 on each delivery. Wozniak wasted no time in moving on to the Apple II. Released in 1977, the updated model kept many of the innovative features from the duo\u2019s first machines, like the 60 character-per-second display screen and cassette interface, while adding more memory and colors to the display. Apple II sold at a minimum $1,298 price point, setting the stage for much bigger cash flow into a growing Apple. In May 1980, just five months before its IPO, Apple released the third generation of its computer. Apple III, like Mac computers of today, forwent the cooling fan. Rather, the computer dissipated CPU heat through the machine\u2019s chassis. On December 12, 1980, Apple stock began trading on the Nasdaq at \u00a0$22 per share. Steve Jobs, the largest shareholder, made $217 million on the first day of trading. By the end of trading on that Friday afternoon, Apple\u2019s stock price had risen by almost 32%, closing near a stock price of $29 and resulting in a market value of $1.778 billion for Apple. 1981 saw Apple\u2019s first shareholder meeting as a public company. Held at the Flint Center at De Anza College in Cupertino. Steve Jobs\u2019 prepared speech was reportedly interrupted several times and eventually devolved into an emotionally-charged rant about respect and betrayal. After Apple\u2019s first two-for-one stock split in June 1987, shareholders received two shares at a stock price of $41.50 each for their stock which had closed the previous day at stock price of $78.50. Throughout the 1990\u2019s, Apple stock price would swing violently. Often times falling below as stock price of $10. But by the time the 2000 boom rolled around, Apple\u2019s stock price skyrocketed above the $30 mark. The year 2000 also brought about Apple\u2019s second stock spell. On June 21, with Apple\u2019s stock \u00a0price at $101.25, Apple issued two shares to investors at $55.62. Five years later, with Apple stock price at an ever-higher $88.99, Apple issued a third two-for-one stock split. At market close on February 28, Apple\u2019s stock price was $44.88 per share. Unfortunately, the financial crisis of the late 2000\u2019s would spell an end to Apple\u2019s good times. As concerns of Steve Jobs\u2019 deteriorating health proliferated, Apple began diversifying from computers, adding consumer electronics like iPod and iPhone. The App Store would debut in the summer of 2008. Four years later, in September 2012, when Apple\u2019s stock price first broke $700 per share (accounting for stock splits), one share of Apple bought on IPO day would now be eight shares with an impressive overall return rate of 25,439%. Thanks to the astronomical rise over the years, Apple split the stock again in June 2014, this time seven-for-one. Three years later, in 2017, with Tim Cook at the helm and a services business providing a bulk of revenue, Apple\u2019s stock price is still steadily climbing. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks",

        "content": "Amazon Stock Falls Amid Earnings Beat On Worries Over Cloud Computing BREAKING: Tech Futures Fall As Amazon Erases After-Hours Gains Amazon.com (AMZN) reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street targets amid cost-cutting by the e-commerce giant. Amazon stock fell in early trading on Friday as management's earnings call commentary raised questions over how long a slowdown in cloud computing growth will persist. First quarter sales for the cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, rose 16% to $21.4 billion, slowing from 37% growth in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected AWS growth of 15% for the March quarter. On the Amazon earnings call, management said Amazon Web Services is seeing slower growth in April vs. Q1. That spooked investors because Wall Street analysts have expected AWS revenue growth to \"trough\" in the June quarter of 2023, then slowly reaccelerate. However, if the U.S. economy falls into a recession, AWS's slowdown could hit bottom later. \"The unprecedented AWS deceleration represents some new multiple compression risk where clarity on reacceleration timing may take a few quarters,\" said RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson in a report. \"Maybe most importantly, there was no mention on the earnings call of a coming trough like last quarter, so walking away we feel less confident that Q2 or even Q3 is necessarily the trough.\" At William Blair, analyst Dylan Carden said in a report: \"The Street clearly remains singularly focused on AWS. Amazon is likely more exposed to high-growth technology firms that are seeing disproportionate financial hardship and need to rationalize spend. We see risk that Amazon shares could trade sideways until the Q2 print when it will likely give intra-quarter AWS growth trends, as investors try to feel out an inflection point.\" The big three cloud computing giants hope artificial intelligence workloads will eventually spark a rebound. Amazon stock rose at first jumped 12% on the initial earnings release in extended trading. But investors tempered their enthusiasm. Shares slipped 1.2% to 108.55 before the market open on the stock market today. Reported after the market close, Amazon earnings were 31 cents a share on an adjusted basis. Revenue for AMZN stock climbed 9% to $127.4 billion. Meanwhile, analysts expected Amazon to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenue of $124.6 billion. Ad revenue climbed 23% to $9.51 billion, handily beating estimates of $9.05 billion. Amazon forecast June-quarter revenue of $130 billion at the midpoint of its outlook, in line with analyst estimates. Also, Amazon said it expects second-quarter operating income of $3.8 billion at the midpoint of its outlook, below analyst estimates for $4.4 billion. In January, Amazon said it would lay off 18,000 workers, the largest cutback in its 28-year history. In March, it announced plans to cut another 9,000 jobs. Heading into the Amazon earnings report, shares in the e-commerce giant were up 25% in 2023. Amazon stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of 43 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock checkup.

Here are the key numbers: It's not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to the Refinitiv analyst estimate of 21 cents per share. Here's how other key Amazon segments did during the quarter: Sales at AWS rose about 16% in the first quarter to $21.35 billion, above the $21.22 billion projected by Wall Street. Still, that marks a deceleration from the previous quarter, when AWS grew 20%. Companies have been trimming their cloud spend in recent months amid a challenging economic environment, and finance chief Brian Olsavsky warned on the call after the report that clients keep tightening their belts. \"As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter,\" Olsavsky said. \"We are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1.\" The shares initially jumped as high as 10% after Amazon said revenue rose 9% from $116.4 billion a year earlier, topping estimates. Even with the revenue beat, Amazon remains mired in single-digit sales growth coming off its weakest year for expansion in its quarter-century as a public company. The stock sold off during the earnings call and turned negative, falling almost 3% below its closing price. For the second quarter,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0said revenue will be $127 billion to $133 billion. Analysts had called for sales of $129.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. The second-quarter forecast suggests\u00a0Amazon\u00a0expects sales to rise between 5% and 10% from the same period a year earlier. \"Our advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands,\" CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings statement. Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, has been aggressively slashing costs as Amazon grapples with slowing sales in its online shopping and cloud-computing divisions. Amazon has shuttered several of its more unproven bets, like a telehealth program and a line of fitness wearables. It's also slowed new warehouse expansion and paused construction of its second headquarters in Virginia, dubbed HQ2. Amazon is laying off 27,000 employees, the largest job cuts in its 29-year history. Earlier this week, some employees in AWS and human resources were let go, following cuts in advertising and Twitch live streaming. Amazon shaved its head count by about 76,000 people to 1.46 million employees as of the end of the first quarter, reflecting in part the recent layoffs, as well as attrition in its warehouses that typically occurs following the peak holiday shopping period. Net income came in at $3.2 billion, or 31 cents per share, during the quarter, compared to a net loss of $3.8 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Operating income in the quarter rose to $4.77 billion from $3.67 billion a year earlier. The company is still dependent on AWS for its profitability, as the cloud unit generated operating income of $5.1 billion in the quarter. Amazon's advertising unit continues to hum along, with revenue growing 23% year-over-year to $9.51 billion. \"Advertising was a strong growth during the quarter at 23%, and that is continuing to hold up very well in an environment where perhaps the underlying sales of products is slowing,\" Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. Prior to the after-hours move,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0shares were up 31% for the year after losing roughly half their value in 2022. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

        "content": "Is Google Stock A Buy Amid Artificial Intelligence Battleground? BREAKING: Tech Futures Fall As Amazon Erases After-Hours Gains Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, how resistant is Google's digital advertising business to an economic downturn? That's a key question for investors eyeing GOOGL stock. Despite mounting competition in artificial intelligence and internet search, shares in Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have advanced 18% this year. Alphabet reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, including one-time expenses tied to cost cutting and higher investment income. Google forecast higher capital spending in 2023 amid investments in artificial intelligence. Google's board of directors has authorized an additional $70 billion in stock repurchases. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $14.6 billion of its own stock. Amid pressure to cut expenses, Alphabet disclosed that Chief Executive Sundar Pichai's pay jumped to $226 million in 2022, due to a big stock award.\u00a0 In a regulatory filing ahead of its first-quarter earnings report, Google disclosed accounting changes that improved the profitability of its cloud business. And Google's internet search business faces a new threat. Google aims to counter Microsoft's (MSFT) investment in artificial intelligence startup OpenAI by making its own generative AI tools available to software developers. One big question is whether integrating chatbot AI technology into search queries will lower Google profit margins. Google's search deal with Apple (AAPL) is another issue, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said in a note to clients. Google pays Apple about $20 billion each year. \"Apple has a revenue share agreement with Google, where a percentage of mobile TAC (traffic acquisition costs) is paid to Apple. Apple could choose to renegotiate with Google for better terms or consider switching to Microsoft when the current agreement expires,\" Mohan said. Meanwhile, Alphabet has stepped up cost cutting. Google stock on Jan. 20 said it will cut 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its global workforce, adding to a growing wave of layoffs among U.S. technology companies. The layoffs follow a hiring spree\u00a0at the company. The U.S. Department of Justice on Jan. 24 filed antitrust charges against\u00a0Google, leaving open the question of whether the search giant will have to divest some of its ad business in order to satisfy regulators. The DOJ claims Google's dominance in digital advertising harms competition. The lawsuit marks the DOJ's second antitrust case versus the internet giant in just over two years. The DOJ in October 2020 filed an antitrust lawsuit charging that Google has monopolized internet search and search-related advertising. That case is scheduled to go to trial in September. YouTube Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki in February announced her departure. She was replaced by long-time YouTuber Neal Mohan. Meanwhile, lawmakers and courts are closing in on fundamental changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law has shielded internet companies from liability for content on their sites for nearly three decades. The internet giant completed a 20-for-1 split for shares of Google-parent Alphabet after the market close on July 15. In the long run, however, the GOOGL stock split could pave the way for the tech giant to enter the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Google stock could be more attractive to retail investors. Due to its huge cash holdings, Google stock has shrugged off three fines totaling $9.3 billion levied by the European Union on antitrust grounds. Alphabet aims to boost its advertising business through e-commerce-related internet search. At the same time, it hopes to chip away at Amazon.com's (AMZN) dominance in product search. Google's internet search business will hold up better than other advertising formats, such as social media, analysts say. Google has rolled out the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates buying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications. Performance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad inventory. Advertisers that use the tools convert more shoppers into buyers, Google says. The big picture: Google stock this year faces more difficult year-over-year growth comparisons in 2023 as the coronavirus emergency fades. In a near-term boost for its advertising business, Google has delayed phasing out internet cookies to 2024. Also, in early 2022, Alphabet said it expected a \"meaningful increase\" in 2022 capital spending, reflecting investments in computer servers in internet data centers and construction of office space. Most investors still know the company as Google, even though the internet search giant reorganized as holding company Alphabet in 2015. The restructuring move separated Google's core internet advertising business from so-called moonshots, such as autonomous vehicles and the Verily Life Sciences unit. In March 2022, Google spun off its quantum computing technology group as a separate company. Google stock's strength in artificial intelligence spans digital advertising, the Google Cloud Platform, YouTube and consumer hardware products. GOOGL stock is just one artificial intelligence stock to watch. At a Google developers conference in mid-May, the company demonstrated how it uses AI tools in a wide range of applications, including Google Workspace, Google Maps, virtual reality, and voice-based search. After a long run, GOOGL stock has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard. The Leaderboard is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics. With the Android mobile operating system built into devices sold worldwide, the Play Store has been a revenue growth driver. A federal judge ruled in September 2021 that Apple (AAPL) must allow mobile app developers to steer consumers to outside payment methods. Google's policies also are under scrutiny. Google in 2021 said service fees at its Play Store would drop to 15% from 30%. The move reduced revenue. Under Pichai, Google has improved transparency. Google began disclosing cloud computing financial metrics with its fourth-quarter report in fiscal 2020. But the cloud business has yet to turn a profit. And YouTube's profitability still remains a mystery. For the March quarter, Google earnings were $1.17 a share, down 5% from the year-earlier period. Google recorded $2.6 billion in one-time charges. Further, gross revenue rose 3% to $69.79 billion. Analysts had predicted Google earnings of $1.08 per share on revenue of $68.9 billion. A year earlier, Google reported earnings of $1.23 a\u00a0share on revenue of $68 billion. Meanwhile, advertising revenue was roughly flat at $54.55 billion versus estimates of $53.8 billion. Meanwhile, YouTube ad revenue dipped 2% to $6.69 billion but topped views amid lowered expectations. Analysts had estimated YouTube ad revenue of $6.6 billion. Google said cloud-computing revenue rose 28% to $7.45 billion, slightly missing estimates of $7.46 billion. Google's cloud business posted revenue growth of 44% in the year-earlier period. A key question for investors is how much should Google's self-driving-car project Waymo and \"Other Bets\" such as the Verily Life Sciences unit figure into valuation. In early 2018, some Google stock analysts projected Waymo's long-term valuation in a range of anywhere from $75 billion to $125 billion. Expectations for autonomous vehicles, though, have been sharply lowered. Waymo in 2021 raised $2.25 billion in funding from outside investors. including private equity firm Silver Lake, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala investment arm. While Google did not disclose Waymo's valuation in the funding round, reports said it was only $30 billion. It could be lower now. Another question is the performance of Google's hardware business. It's battling Apple\u00a0in smartphones and Amazon in smart-home appliances. Also, Google's acquisition of smartwatch maker Fitbit closed in January 2022. The $2.1 billion purchase should help Google make a push into the health and fitness market, analysts say. Google's cloud computing business, meanwhile, faces tough rivals in Amazon and Microsoft. Google brought in Thomas Kurian, a former Oracle (ORCL) executive, to improve performance in the corporate market. Bulls say Google Cloud Platform is taking share as it focuses on security, open source software and data analytics. In 2019, Google purchased data analytics firm Looker for $2.6 billion in cash. Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Looker's analytics platform uses business intelligence and data visualization tools. More acquisitions to boost Google's cloud business could be coming, analysts say. Google acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant (MNDT) for $23 per share in an all-cash $5.4 billion deal. GOOGL stock jumped 65% in 2021. But in 2022 Google shares dropped 39%. Meanwhile, Google's Relative Strength Rating stands at 62 out of a best possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better. Google stock owns an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Shares hold an IBD Composite Rating of 86 out of a best possible 99. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better. Google stock recently forged a cup-with-handle buy point of 106.69, according to MarketSmith analysis. As of the market open on April 26, Google stock trades 3% below an entry point. Investors may want to be cautious amid volatility in technology stocks.

Cathie Wood Would, Of Course BREAKING: Tech Futures Fall As Amazon Erases After-Hours Gains As Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped Wednesday, falling to a three-month low on an analyst downgrade, Cathie Wood continued her pattern of loading up on the EV giant during big share price dips. Wood's Ark Investment Management spent an estimated $29 million on more than 190,000 TSLA shares Wednesday, after Tesla sank 4.3% following a downgrade. As of Thursday, Tesla stock is the top holding in ARK Investment with a weight of 9.66%. The recent Tesla stock purchases were done through ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). The total worth of Wednesday's buys is around $29.36 million, based on Tesla stock's closing price of 153.75. Wood's decision to jump in on Tesla stock Wednesday follows purchases worth more than $40 million a week ago. That buying spree came as Tesla sank nearly 10% following the EV company's Q1 earnings. On March 8, Wood, with Tesla tock slipping 3%, scooped up $12.62 million worth of TSLA. Wood also grabbed a hefty share of Tesla stock on Jan. 3. TSLA shares plummeted more than 12% that day, the worst showing in 2023 and Wood purchased around $19 million of Tesla stock. Three days later, TSLA hit bear-market lows of 101.81. Wood has purchased 1.64 million shares so far in 2023. Tesla fell 4.3% to 153.75 in Wednesday's market trade, after an analyst downgraded TSLA, hinting the global EV giant may need a \"reset\" and raising questions whether huge Tesla profits were temporary. A Jefferies analyst dropped the firm's rating for Tesla to \"Hold,\" down from \"Buy.\" Analyst Philippe Houchois also cut his Tesla stock price target to 185, down from 230. \"We cut our rating to Hold pending a reset of performance and possibly governance,\" Houchois wrote. Houchois added Tesla's strategy of growth over margin has its \"logic and resets expectations.\" However, it also poses a question whether its profit edge was structural or a timing difference, according to the analyst. Jefferies slightly trimmed 2023 forecasts for Tesla revenue, profit margins, deliveries and free cash flow. Tesla jumped 4.2% to 160.20 Thursday during market trade. The stock plunged 10.8% last week to its worst levels since late January. Most of the decline came Thursday, after Tesla reported its gross margin dived more than expected and Elon Musk signaled more declines could be coming. TSLA stock has dropped\u00a0 23% in April. Tesla stock no longer has a base. If Tesla rebounds it could form a double-bottom base with a 207.89 buy point. Tesla sits fourth in IBD's Auto Manufacturers\u00a0industry group. TSLA has a 62 Composite Rating out of 99. The stock has also has a 20 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating is 92 out of 99. Please follow Kit Norton on Twitter @KitNorton for more coverage.

Nvidia stock price is the cause of much conversation and is one of the most popular stocks for younger traders across the global Nvidia was founded in 1993 by now CEO Jensen Huang, as well as Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. In 1995, the company brought its first product, a multimedia card, to market. The company\u2019s first big success came a couple years later when the company sold 1 million units of its RIVE 128 processor in the first four months it was sold. A couple years after that, in 1999, the company launches its first graphics processing unit. (read more) On January 22, 1999, the company holds its initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange the Nvidia stock price was $12 a share. Nvidia traded under the ticker NVDA. \u00a0It offered 3.5 million shares in its IPO. Just two years after going public, Nvidia was added the the S&P 500 in 2001. The company was the fastest every semiconductor company to reach $1 billion in revenue. The company continued to grow quickly from there. Nvidia stock price hit a then all time high of over $23 in January 2002 but Nvidia stock price dropped dramatically back down to single figures in the same year. When, in 2004, the SLI connection standard was released, Nvidia saw a huge bump in the processing power it could achieve on a single machine. It was after 2005 when Nvidia stock price started generating interest and attention but still faced peaks and troughs. Perhaps the most consequential advance in Nvidia\u2019s history was the 2006 launch of the company\u2019s CUDA development platform. The platform allowed the company\u2019s GPUs to be used for more than rendering graphics, and would eventually prove to be one of Nvidia\u2019s biggest advantages in the explosively growing world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2007, the company achieved its first ever quarter with more than $1 billion in revenue, and was named company of the year by Forbes magazine, Nvidia stock price increased on the news. It was also awarded an Emmy award for the potential it helped unlock in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Nvidia dove head-first into the artificial intelligence space, releasing its first \u201cDrive\u201d chip for autonomous driving in cars, as well as its \u201cJetson\u201d chip made for embedded computing on smaller AI-powered devices. Nvidia reaffirmed its AI prowess in its third quarter earnings report of 2016. Nvidia stock price rose about 30% after the company nearly doubled analyst earnings expectations. The company\u2019s data center business, which is where many of its chips are bought for AI processing, brought in $240 million in revenue in the quarter. Nvidia came into a bit of trouble after a report from Citron research at the end of 2016 said the company wasn\u2019t actually gaining new business, just stealing market share from its rival, AMD. Nvidia stock price stock fell by about 7% after the report. Nvidia stock price quickly recovered however, and continued to march higher. In May of 2017, Nvidia released its Volta architecture of chips, that was such a dramatic increase in computing power that Nvidia stock price shot up about 17%, or $18 in a single day. The increase in attention placed on artificial intelligence research has provided a huge boost for Nvidia. Since the start of 2016, the company has seen a nearly 400% annual increase in Nvidia stock price. Before 2016, the company saw an annual growth rate just under 20%.

        "content": "Johnson & Johnson  Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. Its common stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the company is ranked No. 36 on the 2021 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[2] Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's most valuable companies, and is one of only two U.S.-based companies that has a prime credit rating of AAA,[3][4] higher than that of the United States government.[5] Johnson & Johnson is headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the consumer division being located in Skillman, New Jersey. The corporation includes some 250 subsidiary companies with operations in 60 countries and products sold in over 175 countries. Johnson & Johnson had worldwide sales of $93.8\u00a0billion during the calendar year 2021.[6] Johnson & Johnson's brands include numerous household names of medications and first aid supplies. Among its well-known consumer products are the Band-Aid Brand line of bandages, Tylenol medications, Johnson's Baby products, Neutrogena skin and beauty products, Clean & Clear facial wash and Acuvue contact lenses. Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical arm is Janssen Pharmaceuticals.[7] The company announced in November 2021 that it would split into two publicly traded companies: one focused on consumer products and the other on pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.[8] Robert Wood Johnson began his professional training at age 16 as a pharmaceutical apprentice at an apothecary run by his mother's cousin, James G. Wood, in Poughkeepsie, New York.[9][10]:\u200a12\u200a Johnson co-founded his own company with George Seabury in 1873. The New York-based Seabury & Johnson became known for its medicated plasters.[11]:\u200a675\u200a[10]:\u200a15\u200a Robert Wood Johnson represented the company at the 1876 World's Fair.[12][13] There he heard Joseph Lister's explanation of a new procedure: antiseptic surgery.[10]:\u200a31\u200a Johnson parted ways with his business partner Seabury in 1885.[10]:\u200a38 Robert Wood Johnson joined his brothers, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson, and created a line of ready-to-use sterile surgical dressings in 1886. They founded Johnson & Johnson in 1886[11]:\u200a675\u200a[10]:\u200a38\u200a with 14 employees, eight women and six men.[10]:\u200a43\u200a They manufactured sterile surgical supplies, household products, and medical guides.[14] Those products initially featured a logo that resembled the signature of James Wood Johnson, very similar to the current logo.[15] Robert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company.[11]:\u200a675 The company sold medicated plasters such as Johnson & Johnson's Black Perfect Taffeta Court Plaster[16] and also manufactured the world's first sterile surgical products, including sutures, absorbent cotton, and gauze.[17] The company published \"Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment\", a guide on how to do sterile surgery using its products, and in 1888, distributed 85,000 copies to doctors and pharmacists across the United States.[18]:\u200a3\u201399\u200a The manual was translated into three languages and distributed worldwide.[18] The first commercial first aid kit was designed in 1888 to support railroad construction workers, who were often hundreds of miles from medical care.[18] The kits included antiseptic emergency supplies and directions for field use. In 1901, the company published the Handbook of First Aid, a guide on applying first aid.[18] In 1889, the company hired pharmacist Fred Kilmer as its first scientific director, who led its scientific research and wrote educational manuals.[18] Kilmer's first achievement as scientific director was developing the industrial sterilization process.[18] He was employed at the company until 1934.[18] Johnson & Johnson had more than 400 employees and 14 buildings by 1894.[18][19] In 1894, the company began producing Johnson's Baby Powder, the company's first baby product.[14] The company introduced the world's first maternity kit in 1894 to aid at-home births. The kit contained antiseptic soap, sanitary napkins, umbilical tape, and Johnson's Baby Powder.[14] The products were later marketed separately, including \"Lister's Towels\", the world's first mass-produced sanitary napkins.[20][21] Kilmer wrote \"Hygiene in Maternity\", an instructional guide for mothers before and after delivery.[22] In 1904, the company expanded its baby care products with \"Lister's Sanitary Diapers\", a diaper product for infants.[23] During the Spanish\u2013American War, Johnson & Johnson developed and donated 300,000 packaged compressed surgical dressings for soldiers in the field[10]:\u200a78\u200a and created a trauma stretcher for field medics. The company donated its products in disaster relief efforts of the 1900 Galveston hurricane[10]:\u200a79\u200a and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[10]:\u200a81 Johnson & Johnson vaccinated all of its employees against smallpox during the 1901 smallpox epidemic.

In \"Try Reality\", the section titled \"An Industrial Philosophy\" would later become the company's credo.[10]:\u200a224\u200a[28] In 1935, Johnson's Baby Oil was added to its line of baby products.[32][33] Both male and female Johnson & Johnson employees were drafted and enlisted during World War II.[34][35] The company ensured no one would lose their job when they returned home. Robert Wood Johnson II was appointed head of the Smaller War Plants Corporation in Washington, D.C. His work ensured U.S. factories with under 500 employees were awarded government contracts.[36][37] In 1943, as the company was preparing for its initial public offering (IPO), Robert Wood Johnson wrote what the company would call, \"Our Credo\",[38] a defining document that has been used to guide the company's decisions over the years.[39] The company completed its IPO and became a public company in 1944.[40] In 1943, Vesta Stoudt identified a need for waterproof tape for ammunition boxes in World War Two.

The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to revitalize downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones. While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired Henry N. Cobb from Pei Cobb Freed & Partners to design its new headquarters.[121] Johnson and Johnson Plaza, in a park across the railroad tracks from the older portion of the headquarters, is one of tallest buildings in New Brunswick.[citation needed] The stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of Route 18 in the late 1970s,[122] after a lengthy dispute.[123] In 2002, the company released its plan of setting up Asia-Pacific information technology headquarters in New South Wales within five years.[124] Johnson & Johnson has set several positive goals to keep the company environmentally friendly and was ranked third among the United States's largest companies in Newsweek's \"Green Rankings\".[125] Some examples are the reduction in water use, waste, and energy use and an increased level of transparency.[126] Johnson & Johnson agreed to change its packaging of plastic bottles used in the manufacturing process, switching their packaging of liquids to non-polyvinyl chloride containers.[127] The corporation is working with the Climate Northwest Initiative and the EPA National Environmental Performance Track program.[128] As a member of the national Green Power Partnership, Johnson & Johnson operates the largest solar power generator in Pennsylvania at its site in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.[129] On September 29, 1982, a \"Tylenol scare\" began when the first of seven individuals died in Chicago metropolitan area, after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with cyanide.[130] Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history.[130] The incident led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson & Johnson's quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by public relations experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management.[131][132][133] On April 30, 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, voluntarily recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines, including Tylenol, Tylenol Plus, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. The recall was conducted after a routine inspection at a manufacturing facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States, revealed that some \"products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications\".[134][135] Affected products may contain a \"higher concentration of active ingredients\" or exhibit other manufacturing defects.[135] Products shipped to Canada, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Fiji were included in the recall.[134] In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said \"a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations\" was underway.[134][135] A dedicated website was established by the company listing affected products and other consumer information.[135] On August 24, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.[136]\nPathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium\u00a0\u2013 the metals from which the implant was made\u00a0\u2013 were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.[137] In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3\u00a0million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.[138] Some lawyers and industry analysts have estimated that the suits ultimately will cost Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve.[138] In 2010 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled some over-the-counter products, including Tylenol, due to an odor caused by tribromoanisole.[139][140] In this case, 2,4,6-tribromophenol was used to treat wooden pallets on which product packaging materials were transported and stored.[139] In 2010 a group of shareholders sued the board for allegedly failing to take action to prevent serious failings and illegalities since the 1990s, including manufacturing problems, bribing officials, covering up adverse effects and misleading marketing for unapproved uses. The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time.[141] In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years.[142] Juries in several US states have found J&J guilty of concealing the adverse effects of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' antipsychotic medication Risperdal, produced by its unit, in order to promote it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper generics, and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with dementia.[143] States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158\u00a0million), South Carolina ($327\u00a0million), Louisiana ($258\u00a0million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2\u00a0billion).[144] In 2010, the United States Department of Justice joined a whistleblowers suit accusing the company of illegally marketing Risperdal through Omnicare, the largest company supplying pharmaceuticals to nursing homes.[145][146] The allegations include that J&J were warned by the FDA to not promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians.[147] The settlement was finalized on November 4, 2013, with J&J agreeing to pay a penalty of around $2.2\u00a0billion, \"including criminal fines and forfeiture totaling $485\u00a0million and civil settlements with the federal government and states totaling $1.72\u00a0billion\".[148] Johnson & Johnson has also been subject to congressional investigations related to payments given to psychiatrists to promote its products and ghost write articles, notably Joseph Biederman and his pediatric bipolar disorder research unit.[149] In 2011, J&J settled litigation brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paid around $70M in disgorgement and fines.[150] J&J's employees had given kickbacks and bribes to doctors in Greece, Poland, and Romania to obtain business selling drugs and medical devices and had bribed officials in Iraq to win contracts under the Oil for Food program.[151] J&J fully cooperated with the investigation once the problems came to light.[152] In May 2017, J&J reached an agreement to pay $33\u00a0million to several states to settle consumer fraud allegations in some of the company's over-the-counter drugs.[153][154][155] Johnson & Johnson registered the Red Cross as a U.S. trademark for \"medicinal and surgical plasters\" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.[156] The Geneva Conventions, which reserved the Red Cross emblem for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the American Red Cross (ARC) and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing use of the Red Cross to continue.[157][158][159] A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on \"aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground,\" i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.[160] This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark.[161] In August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the ARC, demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.[162] In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.[163] Since 2003, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering heart stent medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716\u00a0million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73\u00a0billion in February 2010.[164] Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute.[165] In 2007, Johnson & Johnson sued Abbott Laboratories over the development and sale of the arthritis drug Humira, claiming Abbott used technology licensed exclusively to Johnson & Johnson's Centocor division. Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17\u00a0billion in lost revenues and $504\u00a0million in royalties.[166] The judge also added $175.6\u00a0million in interest to bring the total to $1.84\u00a0billion.[167] This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history[166] until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of Takeda and Pfizer for over $2.1\u00a0billion.[168] In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict[167] and in 2011 won the appeal.[169] Tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure.[170] In Australia, more than 700 women began a class action against the company in the Federal Court of Australia in 2017, telling the court they \"suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications\". The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which \"aggressively marketed\" the implants \"failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately\".[171] Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available.[172] In November 2019 the Federal Court of Australia found Johnson & Johnson negligent.[173] The judgment was appealed, with the appeals court upholding all findings of Justice Anna Katzman.[174] Ethicon then sought a High Court decision but this was not permitted by the High Court of Australia. Subsequently (September 2022) a $AU 300, 000, 000 compensation agreement was reached between Shine Lawyers and J&J but this agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Australia.[173] In the US in 2016 the U.S. states of California and Washington filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception.[170] In October 2019, the company and its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. reached a settlement with 41 states and the District of Columbia, with no admission of liability, in a suit alleging deceptive marketing of transvaginal surgical-mesh devices. The suit also alleges that the company failed to disclose risks associated with the product, which J&J pulled from the US market in 2012. The amount settled in the suit was about $117\u00a0million.[175] J&J has been the subject of over 26,000 lawsuits claiming that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. The lawsuits focus on claims that the talc-based powder is contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen commonly found in places where talc is mined.[176] In 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72\u00a0million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015. The company said it would appeal.[177] A year later, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product. The company says that 70% of its Baby Powder is used by adults.[178] Later that year, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417\u00a0million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70\u00a0million in compensatory damages and $347\u00a0million in punitive damages. J&J said they would appeal the verdict.[179] The Missouri Eastern District appeals court later negated a $72\u00a0million jury verdict in the Jacqueline Fox lawsuit, ruling it lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed. Subsequently, this ruling killed three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200\u00a0million combined. Fox, 62, of Birmingham, Alabama, died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in St. Louis Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri.[180] A St. Louis jury awarded nearly $4.7\u00a0billion in damages to 22 women and their families in 2018 after they claimed that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.[181] In August, J&J said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to make consumers more confident that products were safer for children.[182] The company was forced to release internal documents with 11,700 people suing J&J over cancers allegedly caused by baby powder. The documents showed that the company had known about asbestos contamination since at least as early as 1971 and had spent decades finding ways to conceal the evidence from the public.[183] The company lost its request to reverse a jury verdict that ruled in favor of the accusers, which required the company to pay $4.14\u00a0billion in punitive damages and $550\u00a0million in compensatory damages.[184] A large study performed in 2003 found that ovarian cancer risk increased from a baseline of 0.0121% to 0.0161% in people who reported regularly using talc in the genital area. Two more studies over the next twelve years, which also relied on self-reporting, had similar results; however, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see dose-response relationship).[185] Conversely, a St. Louis jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in the case of a single plaintiff who had used the company's talc-containing baby powder for thirty years with a similar claim.[186] The company's CEO, Alex Gorsky, declined to appear at a United States congressional hearing on the safety of J&J's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company's offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products.[187] In response to declining demand, J&J announced it would discontinue the sale of talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada in 2020, but would continue to sell it in other markets. In a statement, the company said that the existing retail inventory of the talc-based powder will sell until it runs out, while the company's cornstarch-based baby powder will continue to sell in the United States and Canada.[188] The Supreme Court of Missouri refused to consider J&J's appeal of a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its talc-based products.[189][190] The Supreme Court of the United States also refused to consider an appeal from J&J, leaving in place a judgment from a state appeal court that had cut the original award to $2.1 billion.[191] Two of the justices had to recuse: Samuel Alito because either he and/or his wife owning or recently owning stock in J&J, and Brett Kavanaugh, whose father led an industry group lobbying against safety warnings on talc products. Representing the affected women during the trial, Mark Lanier remarked that the Supreme Court's decision sent \"a clear message to the rich and powerful: You will be held to account when you cause grievous harm under our system of equal justice under law.\"[192][193] J&J had argued that the combined claims in the St. Louis trial were too different, yet the short jury deliberation and identical payouts were, therefore, a violation of the company's due process and also that the high punitive award was unconstitutional.[176] In 2021, Johnson & Johnson subsidiary LTL Management LLC, using a process called a Texas divisional merger, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in North Carolina. The process allowed by Texas law lets a company create a separate subsidiary to take over liabilities, with the existing company operating normally. The new company, with a different name, can locate in a state such as North Carolina where bankruptcy laws are different, and then declare bankruptcy, paying less than the original company would have. In the case of LTL, a $2 billion trust will be created, compared to $25 billion if Johnson & Johnson had declared bankruptcy. According to the filing, a company known as Old JJCI took on the baby powder related liabilities in 1979, while Johnson & Johnson remained a defendant. LTL and New JJCI were created with LTL taking the baby powder related liabilities and some assets, and New JJCI taking the remaining assets. Johnson & Johnson says LTL is now based in New Jersey.[194][195] The company announced that it would stop making talc-based powder by 2023 and replace it with cornstarch-based powders. The company says the talc-based powder is safe to use and does not contain asbestos.[196] In 2023, the number of lawsuits regarding talc-based baby powder has exceeded 40,000 as more claimants come forward to say that the company's product caused them to have cancer. Johnson & Johnson have now reportedly offered $9 billion to settle all the lawsuits against the company, up from the previous figure of $2 billion.[197] By 2018, the company had become embroiled in the opioid epidemic in the United States and had become a target of lawsuits.[198][199] Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against J&J and its competitors.[200] In Idaho, J&J is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partially to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths.[201] The first major trial began in Oklahoma in May 2019.[202] On August 26, 2019, the Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572\u00a0million for their part in the opioid crisis,[203] and in October J&J paid $20.4\u00a0million to two Ohio counties fighting the opioid epidemic.[204] In January 2022, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay up to $5 billion as part of a $26 billion settlement which included McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health.[205] Had the states gone to court, the companies could have faced up to $95 billion in penalties.[206] In October 2019, the company agreed to a settlement of $20.4\u00a0million with two Ohio counties\u00a0\u2013 Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Summit (Akron). The settlement allows the company avoidance of a trial accusing J&J and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers of helping to spark the US opioid epidemic. The trial was thought to be an indicator for thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against many drug manufacturers. The arrangement, which contains no admission of liability by the company, provides the counties $10\u00a0million in cash, $5\u00a0million for legal expenses and $5.4\u00a0million in contributions to opioid-related non-profit organizations in the counties.[207] Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries engage with the public and private sectors in a variety of settings including to promote research and development, academic funding, event sponsorship, philanthropy, and political lobbying. Johnson & Johnson is engaged in various forms of lobbying in the United States, Canada and internationally, including through corporate philanthropy and membership in lobbying organizations. J&J has provided research grants and major funding to the C. D. Howe Institute.[216]",
